I am a Master's student in KIT Mechatronik und Informationstechnik. My current research interest is VLA-based manipulation and diffusion policy.

Previously I received my Bachelor's Degree in Automation from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2022. My undergraduate research focused on gesture recognition and its application on Human-robot interaction. 

After my graduation I entered the [Fast Lab](http://zju-fast.com/) as Research assisitant in Field Intelligent Robotics Engineering Group advised by [PhD.Yanjun Cao](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/yanjun-cao/). I designed MPC control algrithm for Yunjing robot and tested the extreme performance of [CubeTrack](https://fast-fire.github.io/CubeTrack/). This experience benefits me a lot.

I enjoy Whisky, come and get a shot with me!
